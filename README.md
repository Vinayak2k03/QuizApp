cd quiz-app
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

3. **Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

npm start
```

## üîß Assumptions Made

- **Internet Connection**: The application assumes a stable internet connection for fetching questions from the Open Trivia Database API
- **API Availability**: Assumes the Open Trivia Database API is available and responsive

## üöß Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. API Rate Limiting (429 Errors)
**Challenge**: The Open Trivia DB API has rate limits that were causing "Too Many Requests" errors.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented a `fetchInProgress` ref to prevent duplicate API calls
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Optimized useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 2. HTML Entity Decoding
**Challenge**: Questions and categories from the API contained HTML entities like `&amp;`, `&quot;`, etc.

**Solution**: 
- Created a `decodeHtmlEntities` utility function using browser's native textarea element
- Applied decoding to questions, answers, and categories consistently

### 3. Option Shuffling Issues
**Challenge**: Answer options were getting re-shuffled when users selected them or navigated between questions.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented `useMemo` to ensure choices are only generated when the actual question changes
- Used Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for unbiased randomization
- Prevented re-computation on component re-renders

### 4. State Management Complexity
**Challenge**: Managing quiz state across multiple components while maintaining data consistency.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented React Context API with useReducer for predictable state updates
- Created specific action types for different state mutations
- Used `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary function re-creation
